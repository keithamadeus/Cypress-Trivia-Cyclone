## Description

Hey there! I just completed an Cypress component and end-to-end tests that's all about making sure our web applications are as reliable as a trusty old friend. In this ever-changing world of tech, testing isn't just something you do at the end; it's part of the journey from the start.  

Tech Stack:  Front-end: React Back-end: Node.js with Express.js  Database: MongoDB 
 Functionality: The app lets you dive into a 10-question quiz, randomly selected, and then bask in the glory of your score.

## Installation
```
npm i
npm run build 
npm run seed 
npm run start:dev 
npm run cypress
```
Installed Cypress: Added it as a dev dependency because every good app needs a good test environment. Configured Cypress: Set it up for both component and end-to-end testing. It's like giving your app a health check from all angles. 
Created Tests: 
Component Test: I wrote a test specifically for the quiz component, ensuring each piece works as expected. 
End-to-End Test: Ran through the entire quiz process to make sure everything from start to finish is smooth sailing. 


## Usage
The Tech Quiz project can be used by developers to practice and assess their knowledge in a fun, interactive way. Educational institutions might adopt this app as a tool for teaching coding concepts, where students can both learn and test their understanding through quizzes. Additionally, tech companies could use it for onboarding new developers, helping them to quickly grasp the fundamentals of the technologies used in the company's stack.

This project was a great reminder of how testing isn't just checking boxes, but ensuring our digital creations are ready for the real world. Enjoy the quiz, and may your scores be high!

  

## Learning Points

In this project, I learned how to integrate Cypress into a MERN stack application, mastering both component and end-to-end testing to ensure each part of the quiz app functions correctly. I gained hands-on experience in writing test scripts that mimic user interactions, ensuring the app meets its acceptance criteria from start to finish. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of how continuous testing can lead to more robust, user-friendly applications by catching bugs that might slip through in a less rigorous development process.
